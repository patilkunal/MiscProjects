Apache can be defined as a reverse proxy, redirecting predefined URLs to different machines on different ports.

Assuming that all requests to http://mydomain.com/foo are to be redirected to Port 8080 on other machine,
and all requests to the /bar directory will move to port 7001 on yet another machine,

ProxyPass /foo http://other:8080/
ProxyPassReverse /foo  http://other:8080/

ProxyPass /bar http://another:7001/
ProxyPassReverse /bar  http://another:7001/



Another option will be to define different virtual hosts and proxy each at the root directory. You have only one real IP address and one domain, but can probably create sub-domains. Your setup will look like this:


   NameVirtualHost *

    <VirtualHost *>
    ServerName www.mydomain.com
    DocumentRoot /www/domain
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost *>
    ServerName other.mydomain.com
    ProxyPass / http://other:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse /  http://other:8080/
    </VirtualHost>

    <VirtualHost *>
    ServerName another.mydomain.com
    ProxyPass / http://another:7001/
    ProxyPassReverse /  http://another:7001/
    </VirtualHost>


You will have to have mod_proxy defined in your Apache.
